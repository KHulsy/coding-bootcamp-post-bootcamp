You can comment out many lines at once.
For the most part you will see single line comments

As in single line comments, any code contained within multi-line comments are not run -

//Topic: strings

// Create a variable named `subject` without giving it a value:
// example: var hobby;
   example: var hobby;
   example: hobby="drinking the tears of mortals"


// Assign a value of "Programmers" to the variable `subject`
// example: hobby = "problem solving"
            hobby= "Programmers";


// Create a variable `firstName` and assign it a value of an empty string.
// example: var emptyString = "";
            var emptyString= "firstName";
            var firstName= "Ada";
            var emptyString= "lastName";
            var lastName= "Lovelace";
            var fullName= "fullName" + "lastName";
            var fullName- "Ada" + "Lovelace";
            var emptyString= "profession";
            var profession= "Computer Programmer";
            var emptyString= "knowFor";
            var knownFor= "first computre programmer";
            var emptyString= "firstAlgorithm";
            var firstAlgorith= "Analytical Engine";

// Assign a value of "Ada" to the variable `firstName`


// Create a variable `lastName` and assign it a value of a string "Lovelace".


// Create a variable `fullName` and assign it a value of `firstName` and `lastName` concatenated together with a space between them.


// Create a variable `profession` and assign it a value of a string, "Computer Programmer".


// Create a variable `knownFor` and assign it a value of a string, "first computer programmer".


// Create a variable `firstAlgorithm` and assign it a value of a string, "Analytical Engine".


// Create a variable `cityLocation` and assign it a value of a string, "London";


// Create a variable `countryLocation` and assign it a value of a string, "England";


// Create a variable `nationality` and assign it a value of a string, "British";



//Topic: integers

// Create a variable `birthYear` and assign it a value of the integer, 1815.


// Create a variable `deathYear` and assign it a value of the integer, 1852.


// Create a variable `ageAtPassing` and assign it to be the difference between `deathYear` and `birthYear`.


// Create a variable `yearOfPublish` and assign it a value of the integer, 1842.


// Create a variable `ageAtYearOfPublish` and assign it to be the difference between `yearOfPublish` and `birthYear`.



//Topic: console log

//console log: "First Name: Ada" by concatenating the `firstName` variable to the back of a string of "First Name: "


//console log: "Last Name: Lovelace" by concatenating the `lastName` variable to the back of a string of "Last Name: "


//console log: "Profession: Computer Programmer" by concatenating the `profession` variable to the back of a string of "Profession: "


//console log: "BirthYear: 1815" by concatenating the `birthYear` variable to the back of a string of "BirthYear: "

//Try it out

//Topic: Concat Values

// Create a variable `statementOne` and assign it a value of a string:
// "Programmers: Ada Lovelace is a British Computer Programmer born in 1815."
//
// Use the `subject`, `fullName`, `nationality`, `profession`, and `birthYear` variables instead of hard coding in the full string
// much like you did for the console logs and `fullName`


// Create a variable `statementTwo` and assign it a value of a string:
// "She is commonly referred to as the first computer programmer"
//
// Use the `knownFor` variable instead of hard coding in the full string
// much like you did for the console logs and `fullName`


// Create a variable `statementThree` and assign it a value of a string:
// "In 1842 she published the first Algorithm, the Analytical Engine, at the age of 27."
//
// Use the `yearOfPublish`, `firstAlgorithm`, and `ageAtYearOfPublish` variables instead of hard coding in the full string
// much like you did for the console logs and `fullName`


// Create a variable `statementFour` and assign it a value of a string:
// "She was a British Citizen who lived in London, England until her passing in 1852 at the age of 37.
//
// Use the `nationality`, `cityLocation`, `countryLocation`, and `ageAtPassing` variables instead of hard coding in the full string
